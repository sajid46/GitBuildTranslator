#English to French

 a simple C# Console Application that can translate text from English into French.

Any 3rd party library can be used, but must be in C# and cannot be hard coded.

Here is a simple test method to use as clarification

public void TestTranslate(string words, string expected)
{
  var results = _TranslatorService.Translate(words, “fr”);

  Console.WriteLine(results); 
}

TestTranslate(“test words”)
// eg: “mots d'essai”

Here are some sample sentences to be translated:
- Farnborough International Airshow, biennial global aerospace, defence and space trade event which showcases the latest commercial and military aircraft. Manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing are expected to display their products and announce new orders * 2020 event was held virtually after the physical show was cancelled due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic
- Labour market statistics: integrated national release, including the latest data for employment, economic activity, economic inactivity, unemployment, claimant count, average earnings, productivity, unit wage costs, vacancies & labour disputes
- City of London Corporation's Financial and Professional Services dinner. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey make their annual Mansion House speeches at the event hosted by the Lord Mayor of the City of London Vincent Keaveny

Front End

Create a front end application using VueJs and Nuxtjs.

Create and design a new login page for https://forwardplanner.com. 
It does not need to submit anything but should have basic validation for a username that should be an email address and a password.
The design is open to your interpretation, but should be clean and simple.
No subpages are needed but buttons can be provided.

For both tasks, please commit all changes into a GitHub repository and share the repository so that the code can be reviewed.
